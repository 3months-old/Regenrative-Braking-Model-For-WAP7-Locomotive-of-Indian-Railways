# Regenrative-Braking-Model-For-WAP7-Locomotive-of-Indian-Railways
A new mathematical model to estimate the regenerative braking efficiency of Indian locomotives, which are already installed with the 'regenerative braking system,' is discussed here. It is demonstrated for a WAP-7/WAG-9 locomotive that runs on Indian tracks.
